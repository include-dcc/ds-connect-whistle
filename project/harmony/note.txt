ds-connect-harmony.csv is a copy of the skeleton harmony file created using the data dictionary extractions. This skeleton was posted as a google doc https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZQeQWZH1eAlsJaud5CspP0IXUdW6b0D-ztqry6NovqQ/edit#gid=402265715 so that other INCLUDE members can contribute additional codes. The harmonization tab should be exported as CSV into this directory and linked to within the project's YAML file under code_harmonization for each table.
